Charles 4

At long last, Charles 4 has been released! Charles 1 was released in 2002, nearly 14 years ago. Since then we’ve been through Charles 2 and Charles 3, both big upgrades. But for the past 11 months we’ve been hard at work on the biggest upgrade we’ve ever made to Charles!

Charles 4 includes an upgrade to the latest and greatest HTTP standard, the latest and greatest IP standard, and the biggest UI update ever for Charles. It is also the first paid upgrade in Charles’s long history.



HTTP 2 is all around you. It’s sneaky and you might not have noticed. Both the client and server need to support HTTP 2, otherwise they will downgrade automatically to HTTP 1.1. So with Charles 3 you would just have seen HTTP 1.1 everywhere. No more! With Charles 4 you can now see HTTP 2 working, and you can use all of your familiar tools; Repeat, Breakpoints, and so on. You’ll spot HTTP 2 hosts in Charles as they use a different icon—with a lightning bolt!

IPv6 is also all around you! If you’re lucky enough to have an IPv6 network and ISP you can turn on “Prefer IPv6 addresses when connecting to dual-stack hosts” on the Options tab in the Proxy Settings. Then you’ll see IPv6 addresses being used in Charles. Feel the modern IP networking (first published in 1998) flow through you!
